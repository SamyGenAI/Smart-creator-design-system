# Infographics Designer

The bottleneck is **design**, not data. The job is to choose the right visual component for each piece of content, ensure no card has dead space, and scale typography so everything feels intentional.

See `references/visual-components.md` for the full component vocabulary and design patterns.
See `references/example-data.md` for complete worked examples.

**Visual assets available:**
- **Illustrations** (`assets/illustrations/`) — Open-source character illustrations (SVG + JPG). Use to fill empty card space, add personality, or illustrate abstract concepts. See `references/visual-components.md` §11 for the full catalog.
- **Infographic shapes** (`assets/infographics/`) — Prop-driven SVG React components: `Pyramid`, `Target`, `VennDiagram`, `FrogJumps`, `Growth`, `Loop`, `Onion`, `Process`. Use these instead of building geometric shapes from scratch. See `references/visual-components.md` §12 for props and sizing.

## Core Design Laws

**1. Never use plain bullets or dashes.**
Every list item must have a visual anchor: icon chip, numbered badge, checkmark, logo, or color swatch. If none of the existing components fit, build a new one.

**2. Every card must feel full.**
- Too much text → reduce font size (minimum 12px)
- Too little text → increase font size (up to 18px for body), or add a visual element
- Target: ≤15% of card interior as empty space

**3. Color signals meaning.**
- Blue chips (`chip-blue #b4eaff`) → features, capabilities, primary content
- Amber chips (`chip-amber #fde68a`) → process, how-it-works, steps
- Green (`chip-green #d2ff9a`) → actions, outcomes, checklists
- Pink badges → numbered/ranked items
- Keep color consistent within each row

**4. Every section header needs an icon.**
Pass `iconSrc` to `GlassNavySection` for every card. If user hasn't provided icons yet, use `null` and note it.

**5. Screenshots and images add credibility.**
When a card has spare horizontal space, add a screenshot or image (`imageSrc`). Especially effective in Row 1 Card 2 and Row 2.

## Design Workflow

### Step 1 — Understand the content structure
From the user's topic, identify:
- How many distinct ideas? (maps to rows/cards)
- Which ideas are lists? comparisons? steps? stats? categories?
- Is there a "hero insight" worth featuring large?

### Step 2 — Map content to components
Read `references/visual-components.md`. Ask: **"What is the most visual way to show this?"**

| Content type | Best component |
|---|---|
| Feature list, use cases, benefits | `IconBullet` |
| Checklist, requirements, actions | `Checklist` |
| Ranked list, steps 1-2-3 | `NumberBullet` |
| Comparison data, matrix | `Table` |
| Brand/tool showcase | `Grid8CompanyLogos` |
| Key quote, insight, CTA | `PastelShadowBorderCard` |
| Numbered section callout (colored border) | `OrangeSolidBorderSection`, `BlueSolidBorderSection`, `PinkSolidBorderSection`, `GreenSolidBorderSection` |
| Numbered section callout (white border + shadow) | `OrangeWhiteBorderSection`, `BlueWhiteBorderSection`, `PinkWhiteBorderSection`, `GreenWhiteBorderSection` |
| Categories, tags, themes | `ColoredTextBoxes` |
| Large stat or KPI | **Build new: `StatCallout`** |
| Hierarchy, focus, layers | `Pyramid`, `Target`, `Onion` (from `assets/infographics/`) |
| Cycle, loop, feedback | `Loop` (from `assets/infographics/`) |
| Process, pipeline | `Process`, `FrogJumps` (from `assets/infographics/`) |
| Overlap, intersection | `VennDiagram` (from `assets/infographics/`) |
| Growth, progress | `Growth` (from `assets/infographics/`) |
| Abstract concept needing warmth | **Illustration** (from `assets/illustrations/`) |

### Step 3 — Present the design spec for approval

**STOP. Do not generate code yet.**

Present the full design spec to the user as a structured table:

```
## Proposed Design

**Title:** "..." (highlight: "...")
**Subtitle:** "..."
**Template:** Infographic / ComparisonInfographic

| Row | Card | Header title | Component | Content summary | Illustration/Shape |
|-----|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1   | 1    | ...         | Checklist | 3 items: ...   | —                  |
| 1   | 2    | ...         | IconBullet| 4 items: ...   | oc-target.svg      |
| 2   | —    | ...         | Pyramid   | 3 tiers: ...   | —                  |
| ... | ...  | ...         | ...       | ...            | ...                |

**Notes:** [any icons the user needs to add, any missing assets]

Ready to generate?
```

Wait for the user to confirm, request changes, or approve. **Only proceed to Step 4 after explicit user approval.**

### Step 4 — Build the data object and any new components
Use the template in `references/example-data.md`.
For infographic shapes, import from `assets/infographics/` — e.g. `import Pyramid from '../assets/infographics/Pyramid.jsx'`.
For illustrations, reference `assets/illustrations/oc-*.svg` (or `.jpg`) via `<img>` tags.
For new components, write JSX directly into the template at the correct row position.

### Step 5 — Write App.jsx and push to Figma
Update `src/App.jsx`, then call `mcp__figma__generate_figma_design`.

## Using Visual Assets

### Infographic shapes (`assets/infographics/`)
These are prop-driven React/SVG components. Import and place them inside cards:
```jsx
import Pyramid from '../assets/infographics/Pyramid.jsx'
// Then in the card body:
<Pyramid tiers={[{ value: "10K", label: "Awareness", body: "Top of funnel" }, ...]} />
```
All shapes accept a `className` prop for sizing. See `references/visual-components.md` §12 for each shape's props.

### Illustrations (`assets/illustrations/`)
Character illustrations add personality and fill empty card space. Use as `<img>` tags:
```jsx
<img src="/assets/illustrations/oc-target.svg" alt="" className="absolute right-[10px] bottom-[10px] w-[120px] h-auto opacity-90" />
```
See `references/visual-components.md` §11 for the full catalog and which concepts they convey.

### Building truly new components
Only build from scratch when no existing component or shape fits. Follow the container pattern:
```jsx
<div className="rounded-[12px] shadow-[0px_4px_4px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)] bg-[var(--components\/card-title\/blue,#b4eaff)]">
```
Always use design tokens for colors, Montserrat for fonts, and fixed px sizing.

## Typography Sizing Guide

| Card content density | Font size | When |
|---|---|---|
| Very dense (4+ long items) | 12px | Full icon-bullet lists with long text |
| Normal (2–4 items) | 14px | Default for all components |
| Sparse (1–2 short items) | 16–18px | Single stats, short callouts |

Hierarchy rule: card body < section label < navy header (32px, fixed) < main title (72px, fixed). Never exceed the next tier when scaling up.

---

## Hard Rules

- `iconSrc: null` always — user adds icons manually to `assets/icons/`
- Never modify header height (51px), card border-radius, or shadow values
- Never make the canvas responsive — fixed 1080×1350px
- `highlightWord` must appear verbatim in `title`
- Escape slashes in Tailwind: `var(--components\/card-title\/green,#d2ff9a)`
- Figma MCP asset URLs expire in 7 days — never hardcode them
- For brand border sections, avoid duplication: compose via `BrandBorderSectionBase` wrappers (`*SolidBorderSection`, `*WhiteBorderSection`)
